Quickserve is an application that provides a platform for users to request and book instant, affordable services such as barber, snow removal, plumbing, mechanic, and carpentry. Building on the success of the application, this project aims to develop a mobile application version of Quickserve to enhance accessibility and user engagement.
This project interests me as it combines my passion for software development with a desire to create a tool that empowers local skilled workers by directly connecting them with customers, eliminating the need for costly intermediaries. Through this project, I aim to improve my skills in mobile application development, user interface design, and backend integration.
